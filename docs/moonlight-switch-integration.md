# Moonlight-Switch Integration Notes

## Why this matters

Moonlight-Switch already owns its own networking stack. It uses:
- libcurl HTTPS control requests for pairing and app launch
- direct socket traffic for streaming and Wake-on-LAN
- mDNS discovery on the local network
- STUN-based external address probing

That means the easiest integration path is not a Moonlight-specific socket wrapper inside `wgsysmodule`.

The better fit is:
- a generic app session API
- route-planning decisions per traffic type
- tunnel-aware DNS guidance
- later, transparent mode as an optimization rather than a hard dependency

## Implemented SDK surface

Core pieces:
- `swg::Client` for service calls
- `swg::AppSession` for app-scoped lifecycle
- `Client::OpenAppSession()` / `CloseAppSession()` / `GetNetworkPlan()`

Moonlight helpers:
- `MakeMoonlightSessionRequest()`
- `MakeMoonlightDiscoveryPlan()`
- `MakeMoonlightWakeOnLanPlan()`
- `MakeMoonlightDnsPlan()`
- `MakeMoonlightHttpsControlPlan()`
- `MakeMoonlightStreamControlPlan()`
- `MakeMoonlightVideoPlan()`
- `MakeMoonlightAudioPlan()`
- `MakeMoonlightInputPlan()`
- `MakeMoonlightStunPlan()`

## Current routing model

For a Moonlight session:
- local discovery bypasses the tunnel
- Wake-on-LAN bypasses the tunnel
- STUN and other external-address probes can bypass the tunnel
- HTTPS control and stream traffic require the active tunnel
- DNS prefers the tunnel when `DnsThroughTunnel` is enabled

If Moonlight opens a session that requires the tunnel, remote traffic will fail closed until the selected profile is connected.

## Example usage

```cpp
swg::Client client;
swg::AppSession session(client);

auto opened = session.Open(swg::MakeMoonlightSessionRequest("home", true));
if (!opened.ok()) {
  return;
}

auto discovery = session.PlanNetwork(swg::MakeMoonlightDiscoveryPlan());
auto dns = session.PlanNetwork(swg::MakeMoonlightDnsPlan("pc.example.net"));
auto control = session.PlanNetwork(swg::MakeMoonlightHttpsControlPlan("pc.example.net", 47984));
auto video = session.PlanNetwork(swg::MakeMoonlightVideoPlan("pc.example.net", 47998));
```

Moonlight can keep using its own sockets and libcurl. The sysmodule decides whether that traffic should go direct, require the tunnel, or wait for the tunnel to come up.

## Next steps for real integration

- add real IPC packing for the new app-session commands
- add tunnel-aware DNS resolution responses instead of route guidance only
- add per-title policy so Moonlight NSP forwarders can opt into the tunnel automatically
- add transparent DNS and later `bsd:u` interception as an optional fast path
